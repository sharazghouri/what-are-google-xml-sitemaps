## Hands-on Walkthrough

### Introduction

When your website is already populated with all the design and information you need, one important part of maintaining it is making sure it’s easy enough for the search engines are to find your content. And this is what XML sitemaps serve for. For you to enhance the way search engines handle your website content, the following is required:

*   Create your site’s XML sitemap - and one of the most popular tools to do this is Google XML Sitemaps plugin
*   Submit the generated sitemap to the search engines of your choice.

In this lesson, we’ll define what is an XML sitemap in more detail and further look at handling sitemap generation in WordPress.

### What is an XML sitemap?

<span style="font-weight: 400">Sitemap is a list of pages on a website that is accessible to all users. An XML sitemap tells search engines detailed information all the pages that exist on their website, their importance, and how frequently you update your website. Sitemaps do not actually increase your search ratings, but when an XML sitemap is present, search engines can crawl your website better as it helps them to locate all the links that are there.</span>

### How do you create an XML sitemap for your site?

Let's go ahead and use Google XML Sitemaps plugin to generate a sitemap for our website. 1\. Install the Google XML Sitemaps plugin and activate it. [![install_google_xml](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2015/12/install_google_xml.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2015/12/install_google_xml.png) 2\. Once you have activated the plugin, go to **Settings > XML sitemap**. 3\. Scroll through the page. There's quite a lot of configuration options, but default values are ok for most sites. You may choose to modify frequencies and priorities of site materials. Update options if you decide to change them. 4\. Click the URL to your sitemap just to take a look what's there.

### How do you submit your sitemap to a search engine?

Click** your main sitemap and all sub-sitemaps** link at** Settings > XML sitemap** page. [![submit_xml_sitemap](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2015/12/submit_xml_sitemap.png)](https://make.wordpress.org/training/files/2015/12/submit_xml_sitemap.png) 2\.
